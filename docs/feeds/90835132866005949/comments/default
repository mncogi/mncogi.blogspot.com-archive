ANYONE on public assistance! This article does not define *fraud*. I just want to say that public assistance programs are akin to the sharecropping system, they do not allow you to get beyond poverty and provide barely enough to survive. For example: There is an income limit to how much your vehicle can be worth while on public assistance. The MFIP grants are so low that no family could afford the cost of housing and living expenses even while receiving MFIP. Then again, most poor families cannot afford housing and there is a real crisis in which affordable, and income based housing is nonexistant compared to the need for it. Funding for daycare programs has been cut. Few daycare assistance programs exist, especially for working families. People do what they can to survive. The govt does not seem to care that they are creating such horrible living conditions that what they see as *fraud* is really doing what it takes to get by.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I do not condone falsely applying for benefits or taking more than what is owed--but I think people who scam the system are a minority. To really end *fraud* would be to overhaul the Social Services and Welfare System to provide realistic, meaningful ways to help people.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8706086701516497888/90835132866005949/comments/default/9087718936635925054'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8706086701516497888/90835132866005949/comments/default/9087718936635925054'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://mncogi.blogspot.com/2007/11/grants-awarded-to-minnesota-health-care.html?showComment=1197005040000#c9087718936635925054' title=''/><author><name>Fire Wings</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00876351922105762716</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='24' height='32' src='http://bp2.blogger.com/_7fQuLvVE-CQ/R-s9IteP5VI/AAAAAAAAAD0/H8Acvh8GATs/S220/Bride.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://mncogi.blogspot.com/2007/11/grants-awarded-to-minnesota-health-care.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8706086701516497888.post-90835132866005949' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8706086701516497888/posts/default/90835132866005949' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-493134061"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="December 6, 2007 at 11:24 PM"/></entry></feed>
